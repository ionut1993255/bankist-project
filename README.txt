Welcome to the Bankist app !!!

On a general note, this is an app that I have built using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript ES6.

I created two dummy accounts with two fictional usernames and passwords.
The first account has username "ii" and password "1111".
The second account has username "cp" and password "2222".
On the first page you will be greeted by the login inputs and after you type in the user and password 
you will encounter the actual content of the app.

The purpose here is to make an interactive bank app that displays current balance of your fictional account,
a list of all the transactions as well as putting in place a way to make new transfers, request loans and 
closing the current account.

The app will logout after 2 minutes of being inactive as shown in the counter at the bottom right side of the page.

Hope you enjoy !!!
